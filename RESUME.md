## Personal Skills and Competencies

#### Spoken Language: English (Native)

### Social Skills and Competencies
I have strong inter-personal skills, with the ability to create well rounded working relationships with peers and colleagues at any level.  I am easily approachable, and a good verbal communicator.  I have excellent written communication skills, and have proven customer-facing abilities, through several years of multiple long-standing customer and OEM partner relationships.  

### Organisational Skills and Competencies
 I have strong time management and project management skills, with a focus on project completion.  I have been lucky enough to be project lead or technical lead on several high focus projects within my current role and within IBM in general, helping to continue contributing to the success of a product portfolio with a gross annual revenue of approximately $1Bn.  I have lead teams of various sizes, and have participated as an effective team player, in both smaller agile teams, and larger departmental teams.  I am able to work well independently and focus quickly, and can effectively pick up new skills and processes.  I am confident and experienced in waterfall, agile and scrum development methodologies, using many practices associated with these leaner project methodologies, such as sprint planning, KANBAN, backlog management and pair-programming, am able to utilise common design and documentation practices, source control systems, and have a working knowledge of both TDD and BDD.

### Technical Skills and Competencies
 I have strong technical abilities in a wide range of tools, languages and practices.  Although my role currently is for Enterprise-grade storage solutions, in which I primarily use technologies suited for Linux kernel-space and user-space module development, I also have a strong passion for a wider set of technologies, including games development and web development, which I practice as a hobbyist.   In games development, I have experience with both Unity3D and the Unreal engine, preferring Unity3D, and have experience with both C# and C++ in a games development context.  I currently have specific interest in VR technologies and at present am most familiar with SteamVR and associated libraries in this regard.  I also have full-stack web development experience, with multiple front-end and back-end technologies, REST and HTTP transport methodologies, and databasing solutions.  In both of these quite different areas, I am familiar and comfortable with solutions designed for large-scale cross-platform build and deployment.

### Specific Computer Skills and Competencies
My primary expertise lies in two areas.  I am familiar with traditional application development languages such as C, C++, C# and Java.  I am also well versed with a variety of scripting languages such as Perl and Bash.  I have used these languages regularly during my current role, but have also obtained skills in supplementary technologies such as OpenGL and DirectX, as well as vector and matrix maths, an understanding of Shaders using both HLSL and GLSL, and a wider understanding of games development pipelines, through my Games Programming Degree and through my own hobbyist development.  I am also experienced in a variety of web development technologies, such as EmberJS, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.  I am also experienced in back-end data storage technologies such as SQL, MongoDB and Redis.


## Other Information

### Activities and Interests
In my spare time I enjoy Music, Swimming, playing and developing Computer Games, Web development and Travelling.  I am a technology enthusiast, and like keeping up to date with the latest development in multiple technology fields.  In particular, I am currently interested in Virtual Reality, and develop games at a hobbyist level for VR technologies in my free time.  I also enjoy model making and painting.
